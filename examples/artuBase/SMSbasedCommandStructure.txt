1) Master Number SMS command
When the eeprom is completaly erased and initialized with the 32 bit (4 bytes) checking cobe "BABE",
it is necessary to set the MASTER NUMBER.
The master number is a phone number in the form of <country code><operator code><phone number>; i.e. in
Italy +393351234567.
To set a Master Number the user needs to send to Artu' an SMS in this form:
1<blank><Master Number>
ex:
1 +393351234567 

2) Allowed Number SMS adding command
To be ready to actuate a command the source mobile phone number needs to be recognized.
The allowed number is a phone number in the form of <country code><operator code><phone number>; i.e. in
Italy +393351234567.
To set an allowed number the user needs to send to Artu' an SMS from the Master Number in this form:
2<blank><allowed number> for the 1st allowed number other then the Master Number
3<blank><allowed number> for the 2nd allowed number other then the Master Number
4<blank><allowed number> for the 3rd allowed number other then the Master Number
ex:
2 +393351234567 
3 +393361234567 
4 +393371234567 

Each time from the Master number is sent a new allowed namber, the old one is overwritten.


3) 00 is NOT allowed

4) How to actuate ON/OFF
The codes 10,12,13 set on/off OUTA, OUTB,OUT3

10 on            set OUTA on (case insensitive)
11 on            set OUTB on (case insensitive)
12 on            set OUTC on (case insensitive)

10 off           set OUTA off (case insensitive)
11 off           set OUTB off (case insensitive)
12 off           set OUTC off (case insensitive)

5) How to set temperature threshold
To set the 2 Threashold (too high temp / too low temp) about the Temperature sensor
The threshold are expressed with the precision of 1 degree.

20 <lower temp threshold> (if Temperature is lower a message is sent to every allowed number)
ex: 20 40 (if temperature is lower then 40 °C a message is sent to every allowed number)

21 <higer temp threshold> (if Temperature is higher a message is sent to every allowed number)
ex: 21 120 (if temperature is lower then 120 °C a message is sent to every allowed number)
